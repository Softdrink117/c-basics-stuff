Messing around with C for the first time. Hello worlds and such.


I've never done anything with C, but I've been interested in it for a long time. My first true programming class was in C++, but it's been over five years; I suspect a lot of this is going to be totally new to me or very vaguely familiar. I don't have a specific end goal in mind, but there are a few different types of projects I'm interested in that would benefit from learning at least basic competency in the language.

I've also been interested in refreshing myself on C++ for a while now, so we'll see what comes of this. Woop de doop.
